After that we'll dive into ActiveRecord  Rails's unrivaled data modeling engine  and then you'll learn how to engage your site's visitors with that data using ActionView and ActionController..Testing is an important part of Rails development (some people say it's the most important part) and you'll learn how to work with Rails's test suite—and see how it can make building and updating complex sites a breeze. Finally we'll see how to extend Rails with additional plugins from the community.There's a lot to learn about Ruby on Rails  so this class assumes you are comfortable with HTML  CSS  and JavaScript.
